# Cake-Shop
This project is an **e-commerce website** that allows users to purchase cakes. The website is built using the **Django Framework**. To order a cake, users must log in to their existing account or create a new one if it's their first time ordering. Users can select from the available cake options, and the system will restrict them from purchasing more than the available quantity. Users are required to input their delivery details, such as their address and contact number.
